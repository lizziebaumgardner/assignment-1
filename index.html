				Earlier in his campaign, Chou “walked the walk”, in which he walked the entirety of the district from Little Neck to College Point. Chou stated in a social media post that he wanted to show “what a people-powered campaign really looks like” by immersing himself into the community. Throughout this walk, Chou talked with community members and local businesses to see the first-hand experiences of the district.

			<h2 id="space">He wants to find a solution to the parking crisis in Bayside.</h2>
			<p>
				Bell Boulevard is one of the main streets within District 19. In 2017, the New York Times wrote about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/nyregion/saturday-night-in-new-york-bell-boulevard-bayside-queens.html#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20locals%2C%20Bell's,the%20busiest%20night%20on%20Bell.">the liveliness of the Boulevard</a>, with it being home to dozens of bars and restaurants that many locals frequent. However, due to the business of the street, parking can be a challenge. Chou stated in a social media posting that according to a feasibility study done in 2015, 1,000 more parking spaces needed to be built in order to accommodate for the constant flow of traffic. However, nothing has been done to address it.

				Chou states that if he is elected, he will propose different solutions that will aid parking and implement the one best fit for the community.

				Chou believes that companies like Con Edison should be transparent with their customers throughout their billing process. While electric bills spike in the summer due to the heat, Chou states that Con Ed has hidden fees within their billing cycles that pay for Con Ed’s property taxes that apply to the <a href="https://www.riverdalepress.com/stories/con-edison-pays-billions-in-taxes-and-youre-picking-up-the-tab,181887">company’s infrastructure</a>. He has posted many videos on his Instagram to explain to voters the severity of the issue.

			If elected, Chou demands for transparency between company and consumer and will urge City Hall to reevaluate this hidden system.

			<h2 id="space">Chou wants to continue to support the CUNY system.</h2>
			<p>
				As an alum of Queens College, Chou has attested to the strength of a CUNY education. Queens College was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/francescawalton/2025/08/26/the-25-top-colleges-with-the-highest-payoff/"> recently ranked</a> among other CUNY schools and colleges nationwide to provide some of the best returns on student investment. In a short video posted by Chou, he further explains how CUNY <a href="https://citymeetings.nyc/meetings/new-york-city-council/2025-03-13-0100-pm-committee-on-higher-education/chapter/cunys-substantial-economic-impact-on-new-york-city-and-state/#:~:text=Alicia%20Alvero-,0:06:54,CUNY%20Transfer%20Initiative%20improvements">adds</a> $13 billion to NYS’ economy which is 10xs more than what it costs to attend. Chou’s opponent, current City Council Member Vickie Paladino (R), has stated her lack of trust in the CUNY education system and states that it needs to be dismantled.
			</p>

			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s no reason for CUNY to continue to exist in its current state. It provides zero economic or intellectual value to our city. It&#39;s a radical training camp and needs to be dismantled. <a href="https://t.co/HKtvI6Z5XY">https://t.co/HKtvI6Z5XY</a></p>&mdash; Councilwoman Vickie Paladino (@VickieforNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/VickieforNYC/status/1942263933181780013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


			<p>
				Receiving both his bachelors and masters at respective CUNY institutions, Chou has positioned himself to fight for a fully-funded CUNY system with reduced tuition for more New Yorkers to access higher education without fear of debt. In contrast to his opponent, Chou believes that the CUNY system aids New York City and its residents by providing them higher education at a lower cost.
